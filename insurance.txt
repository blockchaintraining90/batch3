Insurance claim process with Blockchain:
----------------------------------------

 Problem Statement:
 ------------------
   Current process is lacking in terms of turn around time and too many process issues at most of the business entities.
   Claimer, Insurer, Regulatory (IRDAI)/, third parties for evaluations, Hospital/travel
    
   As a customer I have visibility only on the Insurer portal end 
   Claim id , current status

Blockchain based sol:
---------------------
 network -  {Claimer, Insurer, Regulatory (IRDAI)/, third parties for evaluations, Hospital/travel}. 90 days (30- insurer, 30 - audting firms, 30- hospital/tarvel)
 smart contract - { } on all the peer
 application - submit txn to this network
  1. cust sub txn , it creates a unique claim id on DLT
  2. claim id is then sent to insurer ----- {cust id, claim id, third party}
  3. clam id is forward to auditor.....{cust id, claim id, third party, ateested}---
  4. 


if claimid.status == 'approved from auditor'
 go to forwardclaimtoHospital



no of claims  > 4, max claim amt = 3000000

1 - 100000
2 - 150000
3 - 150000

   100000 ----

if claimid.status == 'approved'
   {
     claimid = 123
     custname = jag
     refund amt= 100000
     quoted = 200000
     eligibe amt = 500000
   }

if end date of claim = current date and lapse days = 190
  {  
  
   call autoapproval()
   call initiateRefund()
   events raiseAlert(func payload changed) (mails, events to devices, send sms, notificaion on ur apps) ---- all parties in the network --- financial implications
 } 


Reinsurance ---->

sir could you explain yaml
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
okay sir
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
So if we have 30 peers, will there be 30 entries of couchdb config?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
okay
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
what are the roles of these many diff certificates?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Authonticity
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Entitlements..
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
ok
from muppala.pratap@gmail.com to All Participants:
if we want add client..do we need todwon network or only we can do
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
All of this is covered in the document that you have shared in y'days session. Correct?
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
majority means more then half.. right?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Ok 
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
what are profiles ?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
And the yaml files are self explanatory as well.
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
pleaase ping the link

from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
Even with docker link shared today, installation is not working 
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
Local fabric binaries and docker images are out of  sync. This may cause problems.
Pulling orderer.example.com (hyperledger/fabric-orderer:latest)...
ERROR: manifest for hyperledger/fabric-orderer:latest not found

from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Are we starting with R3 Corda now?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
nope
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
No sir
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
No
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
No
from anukeerthi71@gmail.com to All Participants:
no
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
no
from vk033397  to All Participants:
no
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
is it facing security issue
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so its a distributed ledger built for enterprises
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
state ?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
could you repeat this slide
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
what about validation 
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
how it is validate 
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
so it should be used in place of permissioned blockchain... as it got scalability feature?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
python
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
julia 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
in fabric
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Ok
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
But if it's a distributed ledger how it has its own transaction?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so the orgs jointly maintain a shared ledger ??? like 1,7
from rameshvelan@gmail.com to All Panelists:
are they part of same organisation?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is the data only transactions ?
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
data can be any thing ? filr, transaction ,image etc
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
ok
from mailtwosatheesh@gmail.com to All Participants:
what is much consensus and so bilateral ?
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
@satheesh... just some dummy texts
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
how corda compares with fabric for performance and scalability?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
no endorsing or intermediary in this case ?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
how is a corda contract different from a traditional smart contract 
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
So notary service is like a centralized netword?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
Is it a node?
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
is this typcally an entity to mans this ? 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Is it a node with higher storage / processing?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so the notary checks whether the transaction has been double spent?? by keeping the information of transactions from different nodes to confirm the uniqueness of the transaction
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Panelists:
does this notary service nodes be replicated just like transaction in blocks
from rameshvelan@gmail.com to All Panelists:
are they common entity? between the organisations?
from mailtwosatheesh@gmail.com to All Participants:
because of no central we call corda is not part of block chain. after this notary i bit confused. could u pls explain
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
is there an effort to standadise the nomenclature ?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
validity can only be done by the nodes in transaction unlike notary ?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Why do we need corda if we have better option like Fabric that is semi decentralized..but this is purely centralized with same services like Fabric ?....
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
My name is Bhakti Thorat 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok so the validity of the transaction is ensured by the parties involved in the transaction; the uniqueness of the transaction is verified by the notary, and neither of them actually needs to use the blockchain
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
in the financial world DLT is more popular than blockchain 
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Panelists:
Is Corda cost efficient than fabric?
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
thank you Abho
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
Sir, can you pls explain that bit more - diff b/w Fabric & Corda
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
what is the tps supporteed by fabric ? 
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Panelists:
Is Corda cost efficient than fabric in terms of network cost?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Panelists:
But there is no replication of data in Corda right?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
what is user base / count between fabric and corda ?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
What's the advantage of using corda over fabric?
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
https://www.r3.com/
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
depends on what our use is
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
I think hyperledger is open source and Corda is not ?
