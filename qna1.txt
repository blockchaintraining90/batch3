thx
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/public-private-keys/keys
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
any eg for Symmetric 
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
ok
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
https://www.kerryveenstra.com/cryptosystem.html
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Done
from santsp@gmail.com to All Participants:
Done
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
its working 
from muppala.pratap@gmail.com to All Participants:
if we cant decode hash key or algorithems..how can we transfer from balock chain toother like eth to btc ..that time how they are knowing amount and the amounts  get transfred sucessfully
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/public-private-keys/signatures
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Here sender of message is being validated...
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Receiver decrypts the digital signature using the public key of sender. This assures authenticity, as only sender has his private key so only sender can encrypt using his private key which can thus be decrypted by senderâ€™s public key.
from gyanadc to All Participants:
tell mw again
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
In diagram it is shown that public key is used to sign. It should be private key. 
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
We are verifying the message here only na?..I think we are not decrypting here?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Sorry for joining late, was DIgital certificates covered before this as well??
from sairakanwar26 to All Participants:
why do we sign a message?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software, or digital docu. 
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/hash
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
 when we send hash value, how the receipent can understand what we have send to them
from davidmdenis to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
Sir can we attach a file instead of simple text ... 
from davidmdenis to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
ok
from phnair@gmail.com to All Participants:
is it possible t get the origianal message , knowing the method that was used " sha-256" 
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
how to add image file here
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Are we going to cover RC4, RC5 and SHA algos in detail???
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
what is the use of hash if we cannot gget back the original value
from davidmdenis to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
thank you
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
I believe it's used for validation purpose only. I may be wrong
from sairakanwar26 to All Participants:
why would u transfer something that cant be understood?
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
so hashing is for just confirming the identity of the sender... and original message should be send via encryption so that receiver can decrypt that... right?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Converting Hash Codes to their original value is an impossible task to perform. This is the main difference between Encryption as Hash Function.  

from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
So, hashing confirms data integrity across nodes. 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
thanks
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
got it.. thanks
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Signing verifies authenticity (who as well due to key) and Hash will check only message integrity.
from davidmdenis to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
very good ,,,,
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
yes
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can you explain hash collision. I see it come up a lot in conversations 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Thank you 
from sripad6 to All Participants:
when to use signature and when to use hash
from mailtwosatheesh@gmail.com to All Participants:
when we go for encrption and when we go for hash ?
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
Header data in block
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
hash
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so each leaf node is labeled with the hash value of a data block and each non-leaf node is labeled with the hash value of its child nodes labels???
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Grouping is only done with 2 hashes only at a time?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
okay. 
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
Merkle is Breaking the Hash for complicity 
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
ok
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Isnt this re-calculated for every transaction add to block ?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
the computer performing this verification and validation will need a lot of processing power for comparing different versions of ledgers
from gyanadc to All Participants:
ok
from davidmdenis to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
the team handling the generating the hash knows all... what happens if they r compromised
from mailtwosatheesh@gmail.com to All Participants:
ya got it! jagadeesh
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Cam you go through the contents of the block header in sequence just to recap 
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Yes
from gyanadc to All Participants:
ok
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
I think each node in the network will create a hash of the message in the body. If for some reason hash changes then that would raise a red flag
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Is this correct statement?
from muppala.pratap@gmail.com to All Participants:
if we cant decode hash key or algorithems..how can we transfer from balock chain toother like eth to btc ..that time how they are knowing amount and the amounts  get transfred sucessfully
from sairakanwar26 to All Participants:
what is the purpose of signing?
from muppala.pratap@gmail.com to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
if we cant decode hash key or algorithems..how can we transfer from balock chain toother like eth to btc ..that time how they are knowing amount and the amounts  get transfred sucessfully
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Thank you
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
the CIA triad - Confidentiality
Integrity and Availability
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so Byzantine fault tolerance can be achieved if the correctly working nodes in the network reach an agreement on their values ??
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
does it men that in byzantine all node should share same consensus?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so the no attack node is a faulty/malicious node //
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
??
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok so the faulty nodes can only comprise of 1/3 of the volume. With 1 being the leader
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Yes
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Yes
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
yes
from davidmdenis to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):

from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
yes
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from sudhanvatilgul007@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from rameshvelan@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from anukeerthi71@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from gprabhu96@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is the leader the same or is it voted using consenses each and every time ??
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
@prashantbkhopkar Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok a secondary can become a primary after ordering sequencially 
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
what is difference between POW/POS/POET?
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
OK
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
then Sybil attack can happne na?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Won't each and every node add a lot of overhead ???? making high traffic communication networks harder to implement 
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
one question in Byzantine in case of 2n+1
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
2(1)+1 =3 
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
In th previous slide, how can then consensus be derived?
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
could u pl unmute me once 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Each node will add response time. So it makes sense 
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
How is leader election linked to Byzantine ?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok got it
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
so leader will only have 100ms to propose a new thing
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
If identity is annonimus then i can participate in blockchain using multiple identity then my chance for proposing a block will be greater ?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so basically bitcoin 
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
No sound
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
tes
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
your voice got stuck
from gprabhu96@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
yes
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
yes

from arjunlamba737 to All Participants:
YES
from santsp@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes , now audiable
from anukeerthi71@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from rameshvelan@gmail.com to All Participants:
in between we lost u
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
I can hear you fine 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
If a miner wins , they are awarded bitcoin. I think its around 6-7. 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Understood. 
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes clear
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
got it
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from varnaag1999@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is it solvable always ?
from chethan.cs95@gmail.com to All Participants:
one more time
from phnair@gmail.com to All Participants:
hash is supposed to return a specific length isnt it ?
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
very clear your explain
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
each miner will have different nonce or same
from phnair@gmail.com to All Participants:
so how adding / appendig zeroes 
from phnair@gmail.com to All Participants:
will get the same lenght
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
in the header 
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
In this example itself, are we hashing in the for loop?
from sudhanvatilgul007@gmail.com to All Participants:
Sir can we use the blockchain demo site to demo it?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
I think over time the problem becomes mre complex 
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
what did the teacher get in this case... I mean what will be the person get which create these problems?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
what if two miners have proposed same block at same time stamp with same hash and nonce?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
who verifies that nonce is right ?
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
so thatt node becomes the leader and others validate and consensus later slowly and it gets registered in blockchain
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
at what time txn gets registered after all nodes validate??
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
what is BTC
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
OH
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
why not teacher get that award for himself... why they are sending reward to someone
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
teacher is more like a protocol 
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
yes
from gprabhu96@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from sudhanvatilgul007@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from chethan.cs95@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
yes
from anukeerthi71@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so the miners bundle up a group of transactions into a block and try to mine
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
all miners get rewards for validating or only leader?
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/block
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
sir coul explain miner and leader thoser are same
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
leader is a miner who finds nonce first
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
thank you
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
So is it true, there could be many miners that dont become a leader  and hence dont get any reward and incur a loss on their mining equiptment investment 
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
ok thx
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
its millionaire or bust 
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is nonce expected to be always a number or alphanumeric as well. 
from nksingh413@gmail.com to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
Please answer...
what if two miners have proposed same block at same time stamp with same hash and nonce?
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
I think reward (BTC) will be halved..
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Can the proof be duplicated for another  block?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
There was an estimation that 4% of all the worlds electricity will be needed to effeciently mine in the future. 
from prashantbkhopkar to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
What is downtime like in BitCoin n/w? Has that happened?
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
In yesterday's session, it was mentioned to get the Lab ready. Do we have a session on Lab today?
from prashantbkhopkar to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
Ok
from prashantbkhopkar to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
Can you explain about the forks in BitCoin n/w?
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
it's asking for 2 consoles..
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
which one will we use?
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
Break for how much time?
from prashantbkhopkar to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
The version of Blockchain - can you explain that please?
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
25 mins
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
what is different b/w malicious node andother node
from gyanadc to All Participants:
why so many crypto currency is there

Actual nodes = 5
n=number of byzantine nodes/malicious nodes, consider we got 2 byzantine nodes
With the PBFT, we set 3n+1, and we compute as below.
3(2)+1 = 6+1 = 7, what should infer out of this 7 now. 
from shruthi.lakshmi@gmail.com to All Participants:
1) While creating the nodes, how can we assume that there would only be 'n' malicious nodes. Will that value not change overtime? How does the network manage that? 2) When one of the miners/leader gets to propsoe a 'new block', what does that essentially mean? Is it to commit the validated transactions? 
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
I am working in Times Internet which has many digital products like times of india, magic bricks, cricbuzz etc.. If we have to build a rewards system such that there is one user wallet which gets filled with reward points from all of these products and these points can be used to avail benefits across all these products. Should permissioned blockchain be feasible or private blockchain
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
All of these products are independent and managed independently
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):

validator has time limt..how many trsaction can be a block in eth approx
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok tx.
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Only the validator nodes will perform the validation and the validators get a reward proportionate to their bets and their stake 
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
no, node removed from network and 32 eth gone
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
In POS also it would take 15-30 sec.
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
POW
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:

from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
could you repeat the example
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is it like a soft ban or permanent one 
from gyanadc to All Participants:
how to minning ETH
from prashantbkhopkar to Jagadeesh (Faculty) (privately):
Burned, In circulation, Creation - are these the only states for ETH?
from gyanadc to All Participants:
OK
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Mostly in permissioned Blockchain networks
from mailtwosatheesh@gmail.com to All Participants:
how round 3 coming as 5 ?
from mailtwosatheesh@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok
from sudhanvatilgul007@gmail.com to All Participants:
since 2 had gone to sleep,can it be selected again before 3 and 4?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:

from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
the difficulty is the number zeros and the nonce is the ith number of getting the expected 0, am i ryt?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
A nonce is the number of transactions made or sent from a given address. Whenever you send a transaction the nonce is incremented by one.

explain
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
Can't we set GAS fee as zero in POS
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Block reward + transaction fees
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Then how the new coins will be generated in POs?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
ok
from arjunlamba737 to All Participants:
THANKS 
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
So there will be no transaction fee ..?
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
ok, got it
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
How then ETH value will increase?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
I think 120 million supply is there for ETH?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
To my knowledge difficulty is calculated using a formula. which is difficulty(genesis node/starting)/current node 
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
in PoW - all successful miners (51%) get transaction fee - True or False ?
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
Leader gets BTC reward
