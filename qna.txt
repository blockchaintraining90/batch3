from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Keeping higher block sizes, to cater to hogher demand for courses in future
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
1MB
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
but #blocks would be more
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
each block can be different size though ?
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok, so there is no overhead with number of blocks
from gyanadc to All Participants:
sall size data
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
thx
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
How do you calculate optimal blocksize, can you in what case would you have a 1MB block size.
from gyanadc to All Participants:
small size data
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
who sets the block size ?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
The founder org sets it if I am not mistaken 
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
How do we set the clock size? WIll it be covered later?
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
how to set block size 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
The structure of the block/chaincode it defined and validated by all participating orgs/peers on the network correct
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is*
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
transaction attributes are fixed or extensible ?
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
one block on one node or multiple nodes?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
can the block size be varying?
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
thx
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can you please repeat the last point related to supply chain
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:

from mailtwosatheesh@gmail.com  to All Participants:
distributed is fine how is it decentralised?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
ok
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can block size be modified, once size is alreay set?
from gprabhu96@gmail.com to All Participants:
can the block size be increased later on, if there's a need?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
So if the timeout can be set the block size can be chosen as higher?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Tx!
from davidmdenis to All Participants:

from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
One block will be stored on a single node or multiple nodes?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can you explain the failure case in supply chain
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes. Take your time. 
from gyanadc to All Participants:
what is nodes
from phnair@gmail.com to All Participants:
for pubilc network, is the configuration (  e.g block size ) etc required to be uniform across all nodes
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Understood. Thank you!
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
All nodes are equal, and the exchange of data occurs without a central server — that is, each computer or node can act as both a file server and a client. Am I correct??
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
the block will be created if one of the criteria is matched i mean either the size (or) timeout.. am i ryt?

What happens when multiple nodes are corrupted/compromised?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Why rewards system may need Blockchain? 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Because chains are required to be valid, it is not possible to have a block in there that violates consensus rules. It doesn't matter what miners do; full nodes will still ignore the block entirely, as if it was never created if its corrupted. 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:

from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
They are compititors so it will not be easy to share every data
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
The compititors will have visabilty only to the data they are privy to  
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
To the rest of the peers, it will another block on the network. But they wont have visability to the chaincode.

How many nodes are possible ?
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
can there be 1 million nodes 
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
ok thx
from phnair@gmail.com to All Participants:
*same
from phnair@gmail.com to All Participants:
thanks
from priyabratajena12 to All Participants:
distributed systems are high availabality but eventually consistency
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
isn't the use of so much computing power required a drawback ?
from priyabratajena12 to All Participants:
what about blockchain nodes, is it eventuaally consistency?
from priyabratajena12 to All Participants:
if so that might be an issue while reading by other system
from chethan.cs95@gmail.com to All Participants:
can there be duplicate hash if the data is same ?
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to Presenter (privately):
DLT - Distuributed Ledger Transaction and i ryt?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Years down the line, the number of nodes will be infinite? Won't this be eventually cost and maintainence inefficient?
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to Presenter (privately):
come again pl
from phnair@gmail.com to All Participants:
who controls the entry of new node into a network ? 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
How the performance can be monitored? Who does it?
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to Presenter (privately):
tnq
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
So if there are 10000 nodes / Peers, data is stored 10000 times .. Is that efficient ?  
from singhalshivek24@gmail.com to All Participants:
for minting a block all nodes need to approve ?
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to Presenter (privately):
So block chain uses -> CH -> Consistency and High availabilty isn't it?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
ok thanks
from gprabhu96@gmail.com to All Participants:
could you please repeat the tradeoff?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Private blockchains are very energy effecient 
from afaqueshaikh to All Participants:
plz read the question before answering, getting little confused Thanks
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Will we learn about the forks in Bitcoin blockchain? 
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Is there a way to overcome that
from nksingh413@gmail.com to Host & Presenter:
Please unmute one by one and take question so that we can understand which answer is for which question?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
overcome the inefficiency due to nodes threshold
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
I think in ethereum they are called validator nodes 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Ok.
from write2arghyasaha@gmail.com  to All Participants:
Hash is generated through the transaction information in a block. If each block's transaction length is changed from time to time then how could we manage the hash and link with the other blocks?
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
Would we have access to these slides for reference.. without having sit through the full recording ? are these stored somewhere in an easily accessible way

Isn't Quorum side chain of Ethereum
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
ok
from afaqueshaikh to All Participants:
if the data is hashed and can not be decrypted then how will we can read the data in orignal form?
from phnair@gmail.com to All Participants:
apart from Public bockchain...Privat and Persmission provider appear to be for profit organization..is that correct ? 
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
few example use cases for public vs private vs permissioned would also help. Also when to go for private vs permissioned.
