installing such wallet and using them how it can behelpful in indutrial or bussiness purpose
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
I have a question on electrum demo we did today. What is the purpose of testFaucet in the flow? Was it just for validation of the address?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Denominations in Ether are as follows --> Wei, Kilo-Wei, Mega-Wei, Giga-Wei, Szabo, Finney, Ether, Kilo-Ether, Mega-Ether, Giga-Ether 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
I think testfaucet is simply used to get test ether from faucets. Each of the testnets has their own faucets to get free ETH into your wallet. 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
uncall block
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
or uncall reward? are these the right terms?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:

from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
