Correct
from prashant1611  to All Participants:
what was the blockchain used? Polygon?
from muppala.pratap@gmail.com to All Participants:
like proof of work..proof of concept how it works ..can u expline littel 
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
does it eliminate Regulatary bodies like SEBI ? 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Can you please explain what is fungible and nft?
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
ERC20 IS BROKERAGE ?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
All the token have same value they can be exchange with each other...
from gyanadc to All Participants:
1 token value
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
TOKEN LIKE A SHARE VALE?

Ok
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
good
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
I have  a question
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can tokens be updated? E.g., what if I sell some shares?
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
OKAY SIR
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
How does redeem work ?
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
saves lots of time and will reduce frauds

I've.a question
from muppala.pratap@gmail.com to All Participants:
if we extend thse to as trade like share trade
from muppala.pratap@gmail.com to All Participants:
how can we achive..as we know bock chan is slow its kind of public..if usse this shares as trade
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
So one token == one share
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
if incase a person took loan will those token for a paricular user will be blocked because its a collateral ?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
apple share?
from prashant1611  to All Participants:
bitcoin is a fungible token with market value. Hence, it works as a currency too. correct understanding?
from muppala.pratap@gmail.com to All Participants:
any fianance use case please...like trading etc
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Yeah
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
S
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
OK

How are the allocation algorithms implemented ?
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
nice idea
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
if incase a person took loan will those token for a paricular user will be blocked because its a collateral ?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
ok
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
yes else one can take loan and then trade the tokens too 
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
could you repeat this slide
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
could u pl come the decentrailzation point?
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
again with the*
from arjunlamba737 to All Participants:
can you please give example of accountable ?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
How a legal body can get view - in case of disputes?
from prashant1611  to All Participants:
the network is permissioned but transaction data will be public. correct?
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
why these interesting names   ....
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Who can come up with the implementations of these ?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can we write smart contract using solidity in hyperledger flavours as well?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
can't hear u
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
push data and get reports?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
push and pull
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
right
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:

from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can we add new APIs ?
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Sorry to interrupt. Is there concept of ABI in enterprise blokchain?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
can there be mulitple validator instances similar to miners ?
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Are ABIs applicable to enterprise blockchains?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
what's ABI?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so its not interoperable with eth?
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Thank you. my next question is can traditional REST APIs interact with ABIs?
from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
pls paste the four lines in the chat starting ABI
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
Application Binary Interface---- EVM/ETH
Application Program Interface ---- enterprise solutions
client ----> ABI ---> ----> Web3/js/ether.js frameworks ----> blockchain
client ----> API calls ----> SDK ---> Blockchain
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
SDK -- Solidity ? 
from gprabhu96@gmail.com to All Participants:
how does seth (sawtooth + ethereum) function? Does it use ABI or API?
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
we can import these SDKs into our project and then use them.. right?

from prashant1611 to All Participants:
something like a windows folder ?
from manbhakhonglah to All Participants:
is it possible to move existing large scale enterprise systems, software, data and processes to the blockchain? 
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
like a .batch file?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
a docker Container can be created on the fly to deploy a particular application or env. All containers are run by a single operating sys kernel and are thus its way more lightweight than virtual machines.
from arjunlamba737 to All Participants:
rept plz
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:

can you explain% this command again 
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
intkey load -f batches.intkey -U http://rest-api:8008
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so intkey is used to prepare batches of transactions that set a few keys to random values and randomly increment and decrement those values??

Actually there a a couple of things that we must impove upon - switching between lab session and your screen also causes confusion. I am using a windows machine - not on mac.
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
what is difference between intkey load and batch submit
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
So are we writing a block on blockchain with this command ?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Panelists:
keycount 5 ?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Panelists:
okay
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:

is the ordering service centralized ?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
understood 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
 so hyperledger Iroha clients need interaction with any one of the peers and that peer will proceed other operations with other peers
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
centralized or decentralized??

So one token == one share
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
if incase a person took loan will those token for a paricular user will be blocked because its a collateral ?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
apple share?
from prashant1611  to All Participants:
bitcoin is a fungible token with market value. Hence, it works as a currency too. correct understanding?

from soujanya.veerubhotla@gmail.com to All Participants:
pls paste the four lines in the chat starting ABI
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
Application Binary Interface---- EVM/ETH
Application Program Interface ---- enterprise solutions
client ----> ABI ---> ----> Web3/js/ether.js frameworks ----> blockchain
client ----> API calls ----> SDK ---> Blockchain
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
SDK -- Solidity ? 
from gprabhu96@gmail.com to All Participants:
how does seth (sawtooth + ethereum) function? Does it use ABI or API?

from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
like a .batch file?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
a docker Container can be created on the fly to deploy a particular application or env. All containers are run by a single operating sys kernel and are thus its way more lightweight than virtual machines.
