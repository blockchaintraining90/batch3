2. set one of the account as ether base
3. start mining
4. stop mining
5. connect to geth console

Steps t install ethereum client:
--------------------------------
1. sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
2. sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
3. sudo apt-get update
4. sudo apt-get install ethereum
5. geth verison

Steps to configure ethereum blockchain using GETH:
--------------------------------------------------

1. accounts --- to connect to blockchain--- global account eth blockchain
2. genesis file --- to read and store some config data to connect to network (production/test/private)


a. geth --datadir ethdata account new
   
   prompts for password , give it as password
    
   0x074D10C36aD137Ed5cc7B5CCB051e2f10614ceE9

b. nano genesis.json

{

"coinbase": "0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333", --- address of the geth node
