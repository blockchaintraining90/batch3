from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
How about the other blockchains - can they not create identities?
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
what is difference with address ? Is it more personal id ?
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to Learner Success Manager (privately):
https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Sure
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
with decentralized ids your details can never be seen by anyone?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Have you shared URL?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Not seen here..
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
I guess you shared in private chat

Hyperledger Burrow is mainly a type of Distributed ledger,which is capable of executing smart contracts using EVM 
from Learner Success Manager to All Participants:
https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can you please repeat gateway ?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
difference between all the hyperledger?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Is burrow only used for enterprise networks??
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
got it
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
no audio
from gprabhu96@gmail.com to All Participants:
which hyperledgers are widely used/implemented in the industry from a prob-solving POV?
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to Learner Success Manager (privately):

from Learner Success Manager to All Participants:
https://www.hyperledger.org/
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can you elaborate on the drawback?
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
plese share these notepad so easy to recall afterwards
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
simple mail transfer 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Hotmail was the first popular email
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
what's a fungible and non-fungible token?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Semi fungible
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
fungible like pysical money?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
coin has the same value as any other fungible is like if every coin of the same type at any given moment has the same value 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so basically to bridge our tokens from one blockchain to another, its like a cross chain swap protocol.

from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
How does it solve perf & scalability ?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Does it also support Julia and python?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Does it use container technology to implement application logic 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok
from santsp@gmail.com to All Participants:
It supports C#?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is this all done by the MSP using a certificate authority???
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is this world state ??
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is chaincode same as smart contract ?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
a chaincode can contain multiple smart contracts 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so only the members of the channel are involved in consensus, while other members of the network do not see the transactions on the channel but are part of the systemwide network. 
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
can you touch upon dlt part 
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
then why should others know?
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
ok
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
can you give an example where it is actually used ? 
from thoratbhakti289 to All Participants:
any Example in any industry which are using  Fabric 
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
th
from davidmdenis to All Participants:
had this been implemented we would have kept vijay mallaya in control???
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
each bank has their own msp right 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
basically it will use and reference a business object in the world DB , instead of reinitating the entire process. 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
endorsing , committing , anchor and leader if I remember 
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
is the role attached to the node .. or is it  dynamic ? 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
should all the peers align to one of these roles or is it flexible and can be updated on the fly as per the use case??
from mrlingam087 to All Participants:
sir could you explain about ldap on access list
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Who created Fabric ? 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Who OWNS Fabric.. ?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Ok
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so they own the entire umbrella
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Linux Foundation licenses the Hyperledger Fabric.
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
What is level and couch db?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
So level DB is a dictionary (as in py)
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
why does the client end up doing these .. shouldn't these complexities be hidden from the client ? 
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
So Commiting peers are just record keepers,they do not perform any validation, right?
from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Attendees:
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/txflow.html
