from Jagadeesh (Faculty) to All Participants:
https://www.blockchain.com/explorer
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
yes
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
Nonce is created by the miner or auto generated ?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Will those half empty blocks accomodate more transactions or its locked now? and if locked, why locked at halfway stage?
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
ok 
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
what is Total spent
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
is it spent or sent
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
they distribute values in themselves
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
There are lots of manupulation in this pool
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
Will those half empty blocks accomodate more transactions or its locked now? and if locked, why locked at halfway stage?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
6
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
okay 👍 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
How typically we should navigate on this page to explore the blocks? Is there a specific patterm?
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
what does distance mean ? 
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
how its not wastage of space
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
could u plz repeat the depth?
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
but we disucssed 7 here its just 1 ryt?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
longest chain will be considered
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
What is the denomination of BTCs?
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
half filled blok is wastage of space
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
I think they are showing Kb kWU
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Does depth 1 mean this block is not added to the network?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Wei is smallest denomination it seems
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
we can see Fees Kb, Fees kWU 
from santsp@gmail.com to All Participants:
What is Block Version?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
The unit Kb 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
or kWU
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
means greater number greater difficulty how
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
What is meant by Coinbase?
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
the diffculty is the number of zeros added to the merkel root  value isn't it?
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
what is the difference between fees and reward 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
ok
from gprabhu96@gmail.com to All Participants:
could you please repeat the confirmations part?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Txn fees are gas fee?
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
so when 21MM is reached, no more reward will be generated ? 
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
the diffculty is the number of zeros added to the merkel root  value isn't it?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
yeah sorry
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
the diffculty is the number of zeros added to the merkel root  value isn't it?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
how the nonce is computed? can you touch base on this?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
@vinuvishwa yes. no more reward. only transaction fee post 21M
from singhalshivek24@gmail.com to All Participants:
how many btc can be minted in a block ?
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
means greater number greater difficulty how
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
whether the difficulty add to all tnx hash or only to the merkel hash
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
tnq
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Can It be possible to increase supply of BTC?
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
as reward reduce to 0 then 
from pranabnayak21@gmail.com to All Participants:
Question - the example block you showed has depth 1. Does it mean it's not added to a network? Because still 6 confirmations are needed
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
that's why decreasing reward?
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
So who is controlling at what pace remaining Bitcoins should be mined
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
So why cant it be mined sooner / faster 
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
This is the protocol and when protocol was deployed supply was fixed can it not be possibl using proxy contract to increase the supply?
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
Do we know the average time it takes to mine 1 Bitcoin
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
10 min
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
Yeah 1 block.. 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
My system got re-booted.. re-joined.
from gyanadc to All Participants:
ok
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
to get valid confirmations it takes 1 hr but to mine 1 block it takes 10 min
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
what is scenerio after all supply finished
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
what is a diff - between originat btc and smart-contract.
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
Is the mining concept same across all different cyptos 
from pkoratakar to All Participants:
only transaction
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
Transaction Fee will exist
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
So as miner i mine 1 block which has 100 tnx approved and added to the chain now i get 6.25 btc which just value and not the blocks .. am i ryt?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
Hi , I had a major power outage so couldn't join. Was there any lab done during this time ??
from sdevang2 to All Participants:
What is the minimum unit for a Bitcoin Transaction.. 0.15 .. 0.05 etc? till what decimal can it go. 
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
Could you repeatthe user A not spent transactions
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
How does the system figure out which transaction in the blocks to refer to figure out that this is the UTXO, considering the same user might have multiple UTXOs? Is it based on timestamp?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
yes
from kannan.varadharajan@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes
from sabu.sumit@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes clear
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
whats the advantage of this compared to the traditional accounting model 
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
UTXO is attached to Wallet ID - 1:1 mapping ....correct?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
tansaction value close to it? meaning?
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes, if 12 btc be transfered in the sense will consider both 10&5 isn't
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
yes tnx
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
This is single entry system
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
This how a small shop-keeper keeps his records
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so its like a weekly/monthy stock ledger kept by store fronts 
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
Can you repeat that once more, pls
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
But the 0.3 is getting deleted right?
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
Ok
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
Thanks!
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
sp unspent transaction outputs are part of the distributed database technology compared to conventional update db models 
from chethan.cs95@gmail.com to All Participants:
who will be bearing the trasaction fee ?sender or reciver
from vinuvishwa to All Participants:
seeing this pending transactions, does the miner pool start using this to divide work ? 
from prashant1611 to All Participants:
shouldn't we say bitcoin reward is kind of in-built smart contract ?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Why were smartcontracts invented?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
ok - ETH is framework
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
for permissioned blockchain networks 
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Thanks!
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Ok
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok 
from singhalshivek24@gmail.com to All Participants:
how are test btc minted because ther is no reward ?
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
When are light node used?
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so heavy nodes contains full blockchain database, and network routing capabilities and light nodes maintain only a subset of the blockchain
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
??
from bala.rhapsodic@gmail.com to All Participants:
here routing in refers to?
from nksingh413@gmail.com to All Participants:
Light nodes contain latest data and if they require any old data they can retrive from full odes..
from ronakrrb@gmail.com to All Participants:
okay 👍 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so basically light nodes verify transactions by providing partial views of relevant parts of the blockchain on demand. To reduce load. 
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
ok 
from meringes_11@hotmail.com to All Participants:
what is a seed node?
from rameshvelan@gmail.com to All Participants:
how a node will approch seed node
from vk033397  to All Participants:
seed node is first Councated node
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
How is recovery if the network crashes?
from prashantbkhopkar to All Participants:
Ok
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
so seed nodes are a completely different entity compared to mining nodes
from abho.sundaresan@gmail.com to All Participants:
they only relay 
from sudhanvatilgul007@gmail.com to All Participants:
seed nodes give the address to the new node?
from sudhanvatilgul007@gmail.com to All Participants:
As to where its to be connected?
from sudhanvatilgul007@gmail.com to All Participants:
okay thank you
