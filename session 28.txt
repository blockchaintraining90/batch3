Start a network:
----------------

1. Run network script to start the network
    ./network.sh 
  a. Generate crypto material for peers, orderers
  b. Pick up the binaries from where we have downloaded the entire fabric binaries and docker images
  c. Genretae a sample config file with 2 Orgs (1 peer/org), 1 orderer, 1 CLI --- Default
  
2. We also have options to pass few parameters while starting the network
   
  a. create a channel
  b. create CA
  c. Create CouchDB

yaml ---> specifying config details in a format (yet another markup language)



15 orgs, 5 orderes----->
 
 1. I need approval from org1 and org2
    policy('ORG1' and 'ORG2')
 2. I need either from org3/org4
    policy('org3' or 'org4')
 3. any of the orgs will validate the txn 
    'any readers'
 4. majority --- 8 approvals




Fabric: golang (java,javascript,pythin,go/anythoer langs using chaincode as a service)

Ordering service: Read, write set {vlue read from DB, value updated in DB}

Notary service (axis, icici, sbi) : will have visibility of all the data in a corda network (ordere/validator) {a,b,c}----> single node with entire ledger
 uniquness consensus that avoids doube spending
